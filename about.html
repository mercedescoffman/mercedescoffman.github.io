    <h1><strong> Howdy and Welcome to my About Page,</strong> </h1>
    <br/>
    <p>My name is Mercedes and I have traveled around the sun roughly twenty-seven times. I love art and music, in particular things that are dark themed and spooky. I love putting on horror movies while I go about my day, or listening to YouTubers playing various games that I enjoy watching. I play PC video games in my free time with friends. I have very little to no experience with coding or formatting webpages. </p>
    <p>Currently, I am in my first of the last three semesters (hopefully) that will lend me to finishing my bachelorâ€™s degree in Educational Studies with emphasis in gaming and simulation design. Once I have my degree, I plan on getting a job that I think would offer the best overall benefits to my life in according to how I want to live. I would <em> love </em> to have a little farm that I can tend to with some chickens and lots of cats, maybe a dog or two, and lots of plants around me. </p>
    <p> I have been working for three years in the Anesthesia Department within the operating room at Geisinger Medical Center before moving to Columbia, Missouri just last April of 2021. I have moved back recently to Bloomsburg, PA. Previously within the year of living in Missouri, I had worked in housekeeping at MU Health Center, and a Health Secretary in the Columbia School District.</p>
    <p> As for my education, I have also went to many universities and colleges such Pennsylvania College of Technology for Nursing in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Collin County Community Colleges for Interior Design and also Nursing in Frisco, Texas. One last school I can add to my lengthy list of educational trials would be Drury University to get a masters in Architecture. I would call myself a jack of all trades and a master of none at this point in my life. </p>
    <p> Here is my <a href="https://mercedescoffman.github.io/Resume.pdf" title = "Resume"> Resume</a>.</p>
