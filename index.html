    <p> The way that you speak to others has an ebb and flow, there is fluidity and rigidity in the language you create. I’ll be teaching you some effective forms of communication that will hopefully influence the way that you think before you speak. </p>

    <div>
    <p> Have you ever felt as though you want to reach into the mind of others and erase an embarrassing or unintentional thought you spoke of? I have, and I always felt that talking to other friends and family to be difficult. Sometimes my messages don’t seem to make a clear understanding. In order for me to reach that level of understanding, I need to learn how to articulate my communication with intent to speak my message. With the use of this webpage, I will give information and tools that will enhance your view of communication. </p3>
