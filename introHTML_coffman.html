    Howdy,
    My name is Mercedes and I have traveled around the sun roughly twenty-seven times. I love art and music, in particular things that are dark themed and spooky. I love putting on horror movies while I go about my day, or listening to YouTubers playing various games that I enjoy watching. I play PC video games in my free time with friends. I have very little to no experience with coding or formatting webpages. 
    Currently, I am in my first of the last three semesters (hopefully) that will lend me to finishing my bachelorâ€™s degree in Educational Studies with emphasis in gaming and simulation design. Once I have my degree, I plan on getting a job that I think would offer the best overall benefits to my life in according to how I want to live. I want to have a little farm that I can tend to with some chickens and lots of cats, maybe a dog or two, and lots of plants around me.
